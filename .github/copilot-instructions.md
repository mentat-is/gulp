1. always provide commented code!
2. comments and debug messages should always be lowercase (except when the line/s are commented code, in this case the case must be preserved)
3. never lowercase TODO:, FIXME:, NOTE:, and similar comments
4. functions, methods, properties, classes and every other structure must be commented
5. all methods, functions, variables, structures must have type hints, mentioning if they're optional
6. generated functions and methods should have a brief description, Args, Returns, Throws (if needed). Note that, in contradiction with 2., Args, Returns and Throws in function/method definition must stay with the first capital letter.
